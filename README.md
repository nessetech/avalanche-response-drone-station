## 📘 Overview
The documentation describes the full design and system-level architecture of an autonomous avalanche-response drone system capable of:

- Automatic deployment from a mountain-mounted drone hangar  
- Avalanche-triggered wake-up and launch  
- 457 kHz RF search for buried avalanche beacons  
- Sensor fusion and onboard detection algorithms  
- Real-time mapping and rescue-team notifications  
- Autonomous search patterns for buried victim localization  

This repository mirrors the public version and provides the editable source files for future revision and versioning.
